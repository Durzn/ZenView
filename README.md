# About this Visual Studio Code extension

Allows to add files or directories to a custom view to have a quick overview over the important files of a project.
Files can be opened and (in the future) interacted with, so all uninteresting files can effectively be ignored.

# Features
- Configuration of links to directories and files to gain quick access

# Known Issues
- So far none

# Release Notes
For all notes please refer to the changelog.
# Planned improvements
- Add option to add files/directories to settings via context menu
- Add context menu to do trivial filesystem operations (the explorer context menu sadly cannot be used, refer to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/48932 for more information.)

I'm working on projects like this extension in my free time. 
If you want to buy me a coffee to keep me awake for more work on my projects, I'd greatly appreciate it.
